        <h1>Are you making decisions with metrics, or starting conversations? </h1>
        <p class="hero-subtitle">Industry standard metrics frameworks are built for benchmarking, not decision-making. They expect you to implement their frameworks just so you can <em>start</em> a conversation about performance. Decisions? That's not in scope. Why not skip all that? Identify and measure what <em>you</em> need to improve to compete instead. </p>

      <h2>I'm Dr. Krishna Kumar</h2>
      <p>I help software companies design measurement systems that model their operations as they actually are. We help product, engineering, sales, and operations teams analyze their processes and find opportunities for improvements, both within and across functions.
        </p>
        <p>My practice is grounded in <em>The Presence Calculus</em>, a rigorous mathematical approach rooted in stochastic process theory. It produces deterministic, inspectable, context-specific metrics—and lets you reason about cause and effect with confidence.
         </p>
      <p>Through The Polaris Advisor Program, I work directly with function leaders and teams to demystify difficult measurement problems and design systems to manage your specific operational challenges. </p> 
        <p> You bring deep knowledge of your business; I bring expertise in measurement design. Together, we create measurement systems your leaders and teams can trust.</p>

        <h3>Custom Measurement Models</h3>
        <p>I don't sell dashboards or metrics tools, though I've built plenty of them.</p>
        <p>I design measurement systems specific to your operational flows—built from your reality, not statistics.</p>
        <p>Your context determines the model, not a tool vendor's template.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="prop">
        <h3>Deterministic Measurement</h3>
        <p>My approach uses <em>sample path analysis</em>—a technique rooted in calculus not statistics, and backed by 50 years of mathematics. </p>
        <p>It produces deterministic measurements and transparent cause-effect analyses. No other measurement approach in the software industry can claim this.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="prop">
        <h3>Advisory-First Delivery</h3>
        <p>I bring sophisticated tools based on years of R&D and fieldwork to the table—but you never pay for them separately.</p>
        <p>My deliverables are insight, a fit-for-context measurement system, instrumentation guidance, and decision processes.</p>
        <p>There is a learning curve to these techniques. I compress this significantly, giving you actionable advice faster.</p>

    <h2>Why Work With Me</h2>

    <div class="credibility-item">
      <h3>I Work in the Open</h3>
      <p>The underlying theory and tooling behind my practice is published openly. The <a href="{{ site.github.presence }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presence Calculus Project</a> provides the mathematical foundation; the <a href="{{ site.github.polaris }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source tools</a> let you pressure test the ideas on your own, if you choose. My goal is to help clients who see what these ideas can do—and want to apply them with confidence and expert guidance in their context.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="credibility-item">
      <h3>I Explain the Why</h3>
      <p><a href="{{ site.dispatch.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polaris Flow Dispatch</a> talks about my philosophy of measurement, modeling, and analysis of operational processes. Often unorthodox and counter to conventional wisdom in the software industry, but always backed with reasoning and mathematical proof. Rigorous thinking, shared publicly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="credibility-item">
      <h3>Your Expertise + Mine</h3>
      <p>I bring expertise in measurement design. You bring deep knowledge of how your business operates. Together, we build measurement systems that explain how your operational processes work and what you need to do to improve them.</p>

    <h2>Is This for You?</h2>
    <p>The Polaris Advisor Program works best with leaders accountable for business outcomes who have already tried off-the-shelf metrics and mainstream theories of software engineering metrics and found them lacking. If you believe context matters—that your organization's operating system is unique and you need a measurement system that can reflect that—we should talk.</p>

    <h3>I am not the right fit if you want:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An install-a-dashboard solution</li>
      <li>Simplistic productivity metrics</li>
      <li>Someone to implement the latest buzzword-compliant metrics framework</li>
      <li>Someone to help you adopt generic industry benchmarks or scorecards</li>
      <li>Instant answers without deeply engaging the system to understand how it works</li>  
    </ul>

    <p>If you're looking for better measurement techniques that adapt to your business reality, and not the other way around, let's <a href="{{ '/contact/' | url }}">start a conversation</a>.</p>
