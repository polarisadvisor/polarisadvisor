        <h1>Design systems that measure how <em>your</em>  company works</h1>
        <p class="hero-subtitle">Industry standard measurement frameworks are built for benchmarking, not decision-making. They expect you to adapt to their theories, rather than identifying and measuring what <em>you</em> need to improve to compete. I help you build <em>bespoke</em> measurement systems that do.</p>

      <h2>I'm Krishna Kumar</h2>
      <p>I help software companies design measurement systems that model their operations as they actually are. My practice is grounded in The Presence Calculus, a rigorous mathematical framework rooted in stochastic process theory that produces deterministic, inspectable, context-specific metrics—and lets you reason about cause and effect with rigor.</p>
      <p>Through The Polaris Advisor Program, I work directly with leaders and teams to demystify measurement and design bespoke measurement systems for your specific operational challenges. </p> 
        <p> You bring deep knowledge of your business; I bring expertise in measurement design. Together, we create measurement systems your leaders and teams can trust.</p>

        <h3>Custom Measurement Models</h3>
        <p>I don't sell dashboards or tools. I design measurement systems specific to your operational flows—built from your reality, not statistics.</p>
        <p>Your context determines the model, not a vendor's template.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="prop">
        <h3>Deterministic Measurement</h3>
        <p>My approach uses sample path analysis—a technique supported by 50 years of mathematics, that produces deterministic measurements and transparent cause-effect analyses.</p>
        <p>No other measurement framework in the software industry can claim this.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="prop">
        <h3>Advisory-First Delivery</h3>
        <p>Sophisticated tools based on years of R&D support the work—but you never pay for them separately.</p>
        <p>My deliverable is insight: a fit-for-context measurement system, instrumentation guidance, and the practice to maintain it.</p>
        <p>There is a learning curve to these techniques, I compress this.</p>

    <h2>Why Work With Me</h2>

    <div class="credibility-item">
      <h3>I Work in the Open</h3>
      <p>The underlying theory and tooling behind my practice is published openly. The <a href="{{ site.github.presence }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presence Calculus Project</a> provides the mathematical foundation; the <a href="{{ site.github.polaris }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source tools</a> let you pressure test the ideas on your own, if you choose. My goal is to help clients who see what these ideas can do—and want to apply them with confidence and expert guidance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="credibility-item">
      <h3>I Explain the Why</h3>
      <p><a href="{{ site.dispatch.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polaris Flow Dispatch</a> talks about my philosophy of measurement, modeling, and analysis of operational processes. Often unorthodox, but always backed with reason and mathematical proof. Clear thinking, shared publicly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="credibility-item">
      <h3>Your Expertise + Mine</h3>
      <p>I bring expertise in measurement design. You bring deep knowledge of how your business operates. Together, we build measurement systems that explain how your operational processes work and what you need to do to improve them.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Is This for You?</h2>
    <p>The Polaris Advisor Program works best with leaders accountable for business outcomes who have already tried off-the-shelf metrics and mainstream theories of software engineering metrics and found them lacking. If you believe context matters—that your organization's operating system is unique and you need a measurement system that can reflect that—we should talk.</p>

    <h3>I am not the right fit if you want:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An install-a-dashboard solution</li>
      <li>Implement the latest industry-buzzword metrics framework</li>
      <li>Generic benchmarks or scorecard metrics</li>
      <li>Instant answers without deeply engaging the system to understand how it works</li>
      <li>Simplistic productivity metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're looking for measurement that adapts to your business reality, not the other way around, let's <a href="/contact/">start a conversation</a>.</p>
